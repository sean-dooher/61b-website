<h2 id="a-intro">A. Intro</h2>


<p>Today, we'll take a look at the <em>priority queue</em> and how it can be implemented
using a heap. We'll then implement our own priority queue (called <code>ArrayHeap</code>),
and then discuss some applications of heaps.</p>


<h2 id="b-implementations-of-queues-and-priority-queues">B. Implementations of queues and priority queues</h2>


<p>We’ve learned about a few abstract data types already, including the stack and
queue. The stack is a last-in-first-out (LIFO) abstract data type where, much
like a physical stack, one can only access the top of the stack and must pop off
recently added elements to retrieve previously added elements. The queue is a
first-in-first-out (FIFO) abstract data type. When we process items in a queue,
we process the most recently added elements last.</p>

<p>But what if we want to model an emergency room, where people waiting with the
most urgent conditions are served first? We would need to serve patients
regardless of when they arrive, since those arriving first or most recently will
not necessarily be the ones most in pain.</p>

<p>Sometimes, processing items LIFO or FIFO is not what we want. We may instead
want to process items in order of importance or a priority value.</p>

<p>The priority queue is an abstract data type that contains the following methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>insert(item, priority)</code>: Inserts item into the priority queue with priority
  value priority.</li>
  <li><code>poll()</code>: Removes and returns the highest priority item in the priority queue.</li>
  <li><code>peek()</code>: Returns the highest priority item.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is similar to a <code>Queue</code> though the insert method will insert an item with a
corresponding “priority value” and the poll method in the priority queue will
remove the element with the highest priority, rather than the oldest element in
the queue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The element with the highest priority may not always have the highest
priority value. Priorities are a function of priority values: if we have a
maximum priority queue, the elements with higher priority will be the ones with
larger priority values; on the other hand, if we have a minimum priority queue,
the elements with higher priority will be the ones with smaller priority values.</p>

<p>This seems like a cool thing to have, but how do we actually implement something
like this? Java’s priority queue is actually implemented with a data structure
called a binary min heap. For the remainder of this lab, we will study the heap
data structure and create our own implementation of a priority queue using a
binary min heap.</p>


<h4 id="exercise-implementing-your-own-min-heap">Exercise: Implementing your own min heap</h4>


<p>The class <code>ArrayHeap</code> implements a binary min heap using an <code>ArrayList</code>, just
like we discussed at the beginning of this lab. Open it up and read the provided
methods.</p>

<p>Notice in the constructor we call <code>contents.add(null)</code>. Think about how this
affects indexing and why we choose to add a <code>null</code> element.</p>

<p>Fill in the incomplete methods in <code>ArrayHeap.java</code> (marked with TODOs) You should not edit the methods without TODOs but you can use them in the code you write. As John DeNero wisely says,
code that doesn't respect abstraction barriers should BURN. Respect abstraction
barriers! (You should able to finish the lab without directly accessing the
<code>contents</code> <code>ArrayList</code>.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>First implement <code>getLeftOf(int i)</code>, <code>getRightOf(int i)</code>, <code>getParentOf(int i)</code>.</li>
  <li>Next, using the previously implemented methods, implement <code>setLeft(int index,
  Node n)</code> and <code>setRight(int index, Node n)</code></li>
  <li>Next, implement <code>min(int index1, int index2)</code>, <code>peek()</code>, <code>bubbleUp(int
  index)</code>, <code>bubbleDown(int index)</code></li>
  <li>Lastly, implement <code>insert(T item, double priority)</code>, <code>removeMin()</code>,
  <code>changePriority(T item, double priority)</code>. Make sure you use the <code>bubbleUp</code>
  and <code>bubbleDown</code> methods when implementing these functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have provided a very basic test located in <code>ArrayHeapTest.java</code>. This test is
by no means comprehensive, so we highly recommend adding your own tests.</p>


<h2 id="c-heapsort">C. Heapsort</h2>


<p>Now, let’s move onto an application of the heap data structure. Suppose you have
an array of $N$ numbers that you want to sort smallest-to-largest. One algorithm
for doing this is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put all of the numbers in a min heap.</li>
  <li>Repeatedly remove the min element from the heap, and store them in an array
  in that order.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is called <em>heapsort</em>.</p>

<p>Now, what is the runtime of this sort? Since each insertion takes proportional
to $\log N$ comparisons once the heap gets large enough and each removal also
takes proportional to $\log N$ comparisons, the whole process takes
proportional to $N \log N$ comparisons.</p>

<p>It turns out we can actually make step 1 of heapsort run faster—proportional to
$N$ comparisons—using a process called heapify. (Unfortunately, we can’t make
step 2 run any faster than $N \log N$, so the overall heapsort must take $N
\log N$ time.)</p>


<h2 id="d-heapify">D. Heapify</h2>


<p>The algorithm for taking an arbitrary array and making it into a min (or max)
heap in time proportional to $N$ is called <em>heapify</em>. Pseudocode for this
algorithm is below:</p>

<pre><code>def heapify(array):
    index = N / 2
    while index &gt; 0:
        bubble down item at index
        index &#x2d;= 1</code></pre>

<p>Conceptually, you can think of this as building a heap from the bottom up. To
get a visualization of this algorithm working, click on the BuildHeap button on
<a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/JavascriptVisual/Heap.html">USFCA interactive animation of a min
heap</a>. This loads a
pre-set array and then runs heapify on it.</p>

<p>Try to describe the approach in your own words. Why does the index start at the
middle of the array rather than the beginning, 0, or the end, N? How does each
bubble down operation maintain heap invariants?</p>

<p>It is probably not immediately clear to you why this heapify runs in $O(N)$.
For those who are curious, you can check out an explanation on
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9755721/how-can-building-a-heap-be-on-time-complexity">StackOverflow</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap#Building_a_heap">Wikipedia</a>.</p>


<h2 id="c-submission">C. Submission</h2>


<p>Please submit <code>ArrayHeap.java</code>. The grader for this assignment will be the same as the test that we have provided for you. However if you pass this test you might still have a buggy implementation. To verify the correctness of your <code>ArrayHeap</code> code you should write more tests to fully test the behavior of your implementation. This also has the benefit of reinforcing your knowledge of how priortiy queue / array heap operations work as you will have to determine what the expected behavior is. If you want extra help thinking of tests feel free to reach out to a TA or academic intern for assistance!</p>
