<h2 id="a-before-you-start">A. Before You Start</h2>


<p>Now is a good time to make sure you've turned in what you think you turned in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/cgi-bin/calnet-auth-scores.cgi">Scores tab</a> of the course website to check that you have
  submissions for everything at the times you expect.</li>
  <li><p>To make sure that your local machine has all tags in the central repository,
  run:</p>

<pre><code>git fetch origin</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>To see what tags you have, run:</p>

<pre><code>git tag</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>If you have a tag (say <code>hw1&#x2d;2</code>), then the command</p>

<pre><code>git log &#x2d;1 hw1&#x2d;2   # That&#x27;s a one, not the letter &#x27;l&#x27;</code></pre>

  <p>will print the log message for that tag, which has a date and time.</p></li>
  <li>You can match up tags with [Scores] submissions by date.</li>
  <li>Note: Run <code>git status</code> to see which files are ones you created and never
  bothered to track, listed under "Untracked files". These files aren't being
  tracked by git yet, and thus aren't part of ANY submission.</li>
  <li><p>After making sure that you've committed all current work in your local
  repository, you can check out any tagged submission (say, <code>hw1&#x2d;2</code>) with</p>

<pre><code>git checkout hw1&#x2d;2</code></pre>

  <p>It will tell you that you are in "detached head state". Despite sounding
  sinister, that's actually quite normal. Detached head means that your git
  repository is no longer at the latest commit, or "head", of your master
  branch (or any branch, for that matter).
  <br/>

  Checking out a tag will allow you to see the exact files you submitted for
  that tag.  Open any file, and you can see the state of that file for that
  specific submission.</p></li>
  <li><p>IMPORTANT: When you're finished looking around in "detached head" state, you
  can run</p>

<pre><code>git checkout master</code></pre>

  <p>to go back to the master branch. This is important because if you start
  modifying, adding, and committing files while your head is detached, you'll
  end up with a very messy git repo that will need some cleaning up.</p></li>
  <li><p>Let's clean up any untracked files that we don't care about. Run</p>

<pre><code>git status</code></pre>

  <p>If you don't see a section called "Untracked files", skip this step.
  Otherwise, look through the list of untracked files. You may notice files
  <code>.DS_Store</code> and <code>*.iml</code> and folders <code>.idea</code> and <code>out</code> under some of your lab
  and homework directories. There are some files that you don't need to submit
  to the autograder for labs, homeworks, and projects, but show up in your
  repository anyways. As the semester continues, this list of "Untracked files"
  that we don't care about may get longer, and this makes running <code>git status</code> a
  bit annoying. Let's clean that up now.
  <br/>

  In the root of your git repository, ie. the repo folder, open the <code>.gitignore</code>
  file if it exists, and create it if it doesn't with</p>

<pre><code>touch .gitignore</code></pre>

  <p>As the name implies, this file contains the names of files that we want git to
  ignore. Add the untracked files that you don't want git to keep track of in
  this file, one per line.  For example, any <code>.DS_Store</code> file or file ending
  with <code>.iml</code> can be safely added to the <code>.gitignore</code>, along with any <code>out</code> or
  <code>.idea</code> folders. You may have other files that you want git to ignore too --
  feel free to add them, or ask a lab assistant/TA if you're unsure.
  <br/>

  Tip: the <code>.gitignore</code> allows you to pattern match files. This is helpful if
  you have lots of similarly-named files that you want to ignore. For example,
  <code>*.iml</code> tells git to ignore all files that end with <code>.iml</code>, in all
  subdirectories.</p>

  <p>When you're done, add and commit this <code>.gitignore</code> file just like any other
  file, that we DO want git to keep track of.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="b-review">B. Review</h2>


<p>We'll start by reviewing pointers, arrays, and OOP. Complete these four
interactive exercises:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi?quizname=lab4a_quiz">Exercise 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi?quizname=lab4b_quiz1">Exercise 2</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi?quizname=lab4b_quiz2">Exercise 3</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/cgi-bin/quiz.cgi?quizname=lab4b_quiz3">Exercise 4</a></li>
</ul>


<h2 id="c-project-0">C. Project 0</h2>


<p>Hopefully you've made some good progress on Project 0, which is due Monday,
September 23. The rest of the lab is for you to work on the project. A couple
of pointers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure you understand the rules of the game. If you have questions, first
  reread the spec <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/materials/proj/proj0/index.html#the-puzzle">here</a>!</li>
  <li>If you have questions, feel free to post on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/jxzgoek4x4j4u6">Piazza</a>. Make sure to
  search to see if your question has already been asked before asking!</li>
  <li>Code with <a href="http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa19/docs/style-guide.html">good style</a>! Make sure to run <code>style61b</code> or <code>make style</code> on
  the necessary files.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="d-submission">D. Submission</h2>


<p>In order to receive credit for this lab, you must attempt all exercises in Section B. There is nothing to submit through git for this lab. Good luck with the project!</p>
