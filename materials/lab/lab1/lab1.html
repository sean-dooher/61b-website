place to ask for help is in the actual lab, so come if you're not physically
here already!</p>

<p><strong>Make sure to complete the bullets below in their entirety before moving on to
the next section. IF YOU DECIDE TO SKIP THIS SECTION, YOU WILL RUN INTO
TROUBLE.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>If you need to set up your personal computer, read <a href="../lab1b/lab1b.html">lab1b</a>.</li>
  <li>Read this doc about <a href="../../../docs/instructional-accounts.html">instructional accounts</a>.</li>
  <li>Complete the <a href="../../../docs/git.html">git setup parts A-C</a>.</li>
  <li>Get a text editor (we recommend Sublime Text or something similar).</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="b-java-compilation-amp-development">B. Java Compilation &amp; Development</h2>



<h4 id="java-and-compilation">Java and Compilation</h4>


<p>Java is sometimes called a "compiled language" while Python is called an
"interpreted language". However, it is likely that neither of these terms make 
any sense yet, which is good, since they really don't make any sense.
In most Java implementations, programs are 
compiled (translated into a form that is easily executed) in a separate, 
user-visible step from being executed, while most Python implementations give 
users the impression that the actual programs that they write are executed 
directly. These are not properties of the languages, however; Java can
be interpreted and Python can be compiled.  But as often happens, even in
CS, people get sloppy in their terminology and fail to distinguish between
programming languages and their implementations.</p>

<p>The Java implementations we use compile Java <em>source code</em> (what is written by
the programmer) into Java class files containing <em>virtual byte code</em>, which may
then be executed by a separate program.  (Often, this separate program,
called <code>java</code>, does a mix of interpreting the class file and compiling it into
machine code and then having the bare hardware execute it.)</p>

<p>Let's see an example. Here is the same "Hello World" program that you used to
test your setup on the Lab 1b page.</p>

<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Here is what the corresponding Java compiled code (called <em>bytecode</em>) looks
like. The virtual machine can interpret this to run the program.</p>

<p><img src="img/bytecode.png" alt="Java bytecode"></p>


<h4 id="why-compilation">Why Compilation?</h4>


<p>At this point, you may be wondering why Java is (usually) compiled. Compilers
are quite helpful for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>They can check for errors prior to <em>runtime</em> (program execution). The Java
  compiler will catch and report errors like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>type errors, which can be produced by giving functions the wrong objects
    as parameters (like a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>int</code>)</li>
    <li>syntax errors, which can be caused by forgetting syntactical elements like
    parentheses or braces</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Catching these and many other types of errors prior to runtime helps to 
  prevent many of the possible bugs caused by programmer error, making Java 
  programs more stable before they are run.</p></li>
  <li>Compilers can help speed up programs. Programs run by interpreters can be
  slow because interpreters must parse text that is understandable to humans
  and translate it into an executable form. Furthermore, for various
  engineering reasons, this executable form is generally not actual machine
  code (directly executable by the hardware), but some other intermediate form
  that another program (the interpreter) then executes. A compiler does this
  translation work once and saves the instructions to a file variously called a
  <em>binary</em>, <em>object file</em>, or (in the case of Java) a <em>class file</em>. As such, 
  Java programs do not have to translate the code at runtime, decreasing the 
  overall runtime of the code.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many other reasons some languages have compilers, some of which you
will learn by taking CS 61C. But for now, you will just need to know how to
compile and run your Java program.</p>


<h4 id="compiling-java-programs">Compiling Java Programs</h4>


<p>There are many different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_compiler">Java
compilers</a>, but we'll be using
<code>javac</code> from the command line in this class.  As stated in Lab 1b, <code>javac</code> is
included in Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK) and should be accessible to you
now.</p>

<p>To compile a Java file called <code>File.java</code>, you would type the following command
into your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac File.java</code></pre>

<p>You can also add some helpful options, which are called <em>flags</em> to the compile
command. Full documentation is available
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/javac.html">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>javac &#x2d;g File.java</code></pre>

<p>The '-g' flag is one of the most helpful flags because it will generate
debugging information, including information about local variables. This is good
for testing programs.</p>

<p><strong>Note: If you change a file after compiling, you must recompile the file to
reflect the change.</strong></p>


<h4 id="running-java-programs">Running Java Programs</h4>


<p>Compiling your program using the command above should give you <code>.class</code> files.
For example, let's pretend that you've compiled <code>File.java</code>. This would generate
a new file called <code>File.class</code>. Opening the <code>.class</code> files will show you
something like the bytecode in the image at the very beginning of this lab.</p>

<p>Once you have your <code>File.class</code> file, you can run your Java program with this
command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>java File</code></pre>

<p>You do not type <code>File.class</code>. Doing so is a common mistake that will cause an
error message like this:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Could not find or load main class</code></pre>

<p>You also don't type <code>File.java</code> either.</p>


<h2 id="c-writing-java-programs">C. Writing Java Programs</h2>



<h4 id="java-is-object-oriented">Java is Object-Oriented</h4>


<p>Java is an <em>object-oriented</em> programming language. What this means is that
you'll organize your programs around the <em>types of data</em> that it manupulates.
Each of these data types describes a class of <em>objects</em> and how these objects
will interact with each other. Those of you who took 61A may recognize that term
as having been applied to Python/Scheme. Java takes OOP a step further. In Java,
all functions (or <em>methods</em>, as the OOP inventors renamed them in order to 
make-believe they were inventing an entirely new concept) and all variables 
reside in some class definition.</p>


<h4 id="format-of-a-java-program">Format of a Java Program</h4>


<p>Every Java source file contains a class, interface, or "enum" (a special kind of
class). For now, let's just discuss <em>class definitions</em>. A class definition
provides the name of the class and serves as a template for objects. In
addition, a class definition contains <em>variables</em> and <em>methods</em> that define the
behavior of that class.</p>

<p>Here is a deconstruction of the aforementioned "Hello World" program:</p>

<p><img src="img/HelloWorld.png" alt="HelloWorld" title="HelloWorld"></p>

<p>A Java program consists of a collection of one of more of these Java files. At
least one of the classes in a complete Java program must contain a method called
<code>main</code> having the header shown in the <code>HelloWorld</code> code above. This <em>main
method</em> is where execution of your program begins.</p>

<p>This is why running the <code>HelloWorld</code> program prints out <code>Hello world!</code>. The
<code>main</code> method in the <code>HelloWorld</code> class is being run when you type <code>java
HelloWorld</code> into the terminal.</p>


<h4 id="comments-in-java">Comments in Java</h4>


<p>There are two formats for comments in a Java program:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Single-line comments start with two consecutive slash characters and continue
  to the end of the line</p>

<pre><code>// This is a single&#x2d;line comment</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>In general, we use these only for temporary comments, or to add explanatory text
to a difficult block of code.  Our style rules require that you <em>not</em> use them
in projects you hand in.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a
   multi&#x2d;line
   comment */</code></pre>

  <p>To improve readability, you can add single asterisks at the start of each
  line after the first.</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a
 * multi&#x2d;line
 * comment */</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Finally, a subclass of the multiline comments called <em>documentation comments</em>
  or <em>javadoc comments</em> are intended to provide specifications of methods
  (functions), classes, and instance variables.  Our style rules, in fact,
  require them.  For example.</p>

<pre><code>/** Returns the current size of the list. */
public int size() { ... }</code></pre></li>
</ol>


<h2 id="d-using-git">D. Using Git</h2>


<p><strong>IF YOU DID NOT DO SECTIONS A-C OF THE GIT GUIDE, THIS NEXT PART WILL NOT WORK.
PLEASE DO THE GIT GUIDE FIRST.</strong></p>


<h4 id="leap-year-program">Leap-Year Program</h4>


<p>For our second Java program, we'll be writing a program that prints out whether
or not a year is a leap year or not. A leap year is either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>divisible by 400 <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>divisible by 4 and not by 100.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years. 1900, 2003, and 2100 are not leap
years.</p>

<p>Your Java file should be called <code>LeapYear.java</code>. These lines should go into the
<code>main</code> method of the <code>LeapYear</code> class. Your class name should match the name of
your file. Your program should include the line:</p>

<pre><code>int year = 2000;</code></pre>

<p>If you're not sure where to start, you can copy and paste lines from <a href="lab1_copy_and_paste.txt">this
file</a> (all of these lines may not be needed and their 
order is scrambled).</p>


<h4 id="some-java-vocabulary-in-leap-year">Some Java Vocabulary in Leap Year</h4>


<ul>
  <li>The <code>%</code> operator implements <em>remainder</em>. Thus, the value of <code>year % 4</code> will be
  0, 1, 2, or 3.</li>
  <li>The <code>!=</code> operator compares two values for <em>inequality</em>. The code fragment <code>if
  (year % 4 != 0)</code> reads as "if the remainder when dividing <code>year</code> by 4 is not
  equal to 0."</li>
  <li>The method <code>System.out.println</code> prints its argument to "standard output"
  (which is, in this case, your terminal window) when called.</li>
  <li>When one of the arguments of the <code>+</code> operator is a string, the arguments are
  concatenated as strings. <em>String concatenation</em> is the operation of joining
  two character strings end-to-end.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="testing-leap-year">Testing Leap Year</h4>


<p>When you've arranged the lines properly and compiled successfully, running the
program should print out the following line:</p>

<pre><code>2000 is a leap year.</code></pre>

<p>You can test your program with other <code>year</code> values by changing the line</p>

<pre><code>int year = 2000;</code></pre>

<p>to other numbers. Once your program is correct, save it as <code>LeapYear.java</code>.
You'll be submitting it at the conclusion of this lab.</p>


<h4 id="general-git-workflow">General Git Workflow</h4>


<p>As you proceed below, be sure to understand what each command does since you'll
be using these commands all semester (if not for longer!). Read the output (if
any) before entering the next command, in case unexpected behavior occurs (it
might mean that you accidentally skipped a step!).</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>You must first <code>fetch</code> from the <code>shared</code> remote in order to get the starter
  code for lab1. You will do this every time new projects and assignments are
  released.</p>

<pre><code>cd repo              # If not already there
git fetch shared
git merge &#x2d;m &quot;Start Lab 1&quot; shared/lab1
git push</code></pre>

  <p>This copies our skeleton code for lab1 into your local repository (in a
  subdirectory called <code>lab1</code>). It then transfers this branch to your central
  repository. Now that you've done this, you can <code>pull</code> these changes from any
  other local repository that you've cloned from your central repository.</p></li>
  <li>Now let's make changes to the code within our local repository. Since we've
  already written some code, let's just move <code>LeapYear.java</code> into the <code>lab1</code>
  directory.</li>
  <li><p>Now we stage and commit <code>LeapYear.java</code> to tell Git to take a snapshot of
  it's current state and to remember what changes we've made up to this point.</p>

<pre><code>git add lab1/LeapYear.java
git commit &#x2d;a &#x2d;m &quot;Completed LeapYear.java&quot;</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Once again, now we push these changes to the central repository so that your
  changes are uploaded to the course server. Your changes will also be
  available to <code>pull</code>.</p>

<pre><code>git push</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Get into the habit of saving your files and doing the <code>git commit</code> step <em>often</em>
(i.e. every 15 minutes). It can save your skin when you mess things up, since it
allows you to back out of changes and to see what you have changed recently.</p>

<p>Basically, right when you sit down to work in your repository, first <code>git pull</code>
to make sure you are starting with the most recent code. While you are working,
frequently commit. When you are finished, <code>git push</code> so all your changes are
uploaded and ready for you to pull again next time. Since pushing uploads to our
course server, you must push in order for the staff to get a hold of your work,
whether that is to ask for help or to have your assignments graded.</p>


<h4 id="complete-lab-1">Complete Lab 1</h4>


<p>If you get confused with the git commands in this section, please refer to
<a href="../../../docs/git.html">Section D of the git guide</a>.</p>

<p>Let's make some more changes! Now that you have the skeleton, you should see a
file in the lab1 directory called <code>Year.java</code>.</p>

<p>Fill it out using code similar to your implementation for <code>LeapYear.java</code>, but
this time however, notice that <code>year</code> is a parameter for the <code>isLeapYear</code> method
rather than a local variable within a method.</p>

<p>After you have filled out that file, you should make a commit since you have
finished making a notable modification. First, check the <code>status</code> of your local
repository by typing:</p>

<pre><code>git status</code></pre>

<p>You will see the file that you just changed in red text, which is Git telling
you that you have outstanding changes that have not been added yet.</p>

<p>Go ahead and <code>add</code> the file. Check the <code>status</code> again and it should have turned
into green text. Then, proceed to making your <code>commit</code>.</p>


<h4 id="running-unit-tests">Running Unit Tests</h4>


<ol>
  <li><p>At some points in your development, you may want to run the autograder. For
  this lab, we have given you an explicit program to show how this sort of
  thing works. The file <code>AGTestYear.java</code> contains a number of <em>unit tests</em>, a
  term that refers to simple tests of individual components (units) of a
  program. In this case, there is one component in question: your <code>isLeapYear</code>
  program.</p>

  <p>You cannot run this file on your local machine yet, so this part must be done
  on the instructional account (either on the lab computer or by ssh'ing).
  However, in later labs, we will remedy this. (If you are switching from
  another machine to a lab computer at this point, remember to <code>push</code>/<code>pull</code>
  first!)</p>

  <p>Compile the autograder with:</p>

<pre><code>   cd repo/lab1              # If not already there
   javac &#x2d;g AGTestYear.java</code></pre>

  <p>And run it with:</p>

<pre><code>   java AGTestYear</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>If your program was correct, then you'll get an encouraging message like:</p>

<pre><code>   Time: 0.014
   Ran 4 tests. All passed.   </code></pre>

  <p>Otherwise, you'll get messages such as:</p>

<pre><code>   There were 2 failures:

   1) test400(AGTestYear)
      should be leap year
      at AGTestYear.test400:12 (AGTestYear.java)

   2) ...</code></pre>

  <p>If you didn't get an error message, try deliberately breaking your program by
  inserting a bug and try testing it again (remember to compile it before
  trying to test it!). <strong>Be sure to undo the damage before submitting.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Note 1</strong>: In later assignments, we may hide the autograder from you, and
  send you email about the results.  We'll explain how that works at a later
  date.</p>

  <p><strong>Note 2</strong>: This autograder may not be running the full number of tests that
  will be used to grade your assignment. (This is especially true for the
  projects.) It should be used as a sanity check, not as a thorough test. You
  should always write your own unit tests (and we will go over how to do this
  later).</p></li>
</ol>


<h4 id="submitting">Submitting</h4>


<ol>
  <li>If you are ready to submit your lab, first make sure that all your work is
  committed. You can do so by calling upon <code>git status</code> once again; it should
  tell you that your working directory is clean.</li>
  <li><p>Now <code>tag</code> your latest commit as a submission. Tags in Git are symbolic names
  given to specific commits.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Create a tag for this commit.</p>

<pre><code>git tag lab1&#x2d;0</code></pre>

    <p>For our purposes, tag names shall have the form of the assignment name,
    followed by a sequence number.</p></li>
    <li><p>Now push your commits and tags to your central repository so that we can
    see them, too.</p>

<pre><code>git push
git push &#x2d;&#x2d;tags</code></pre></li>
    <li>You won't receive any indication of your submission this time, so do not
    worry about that.</li>
    <li>You can continue updating your work and submitting newer versions by
    following the same procedures (remember to <em>always</em> commit before you
    tag). Just increase the sequence number to keep the submissions distinct:
    lab1-1, lab1-2, etc. The actual numbers don't matter; the largest is your
    official latest submission at any time.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>These last few sub-sections were a bare-bones walkthrough of Sections D and E of
the <a href="../../../docs/git.html">Git guide</a> and we used the commands described there to complete
this lab. Be sure to refer back to the Git guide to ensure that you submit all
future assignments properly. You will find Section F of the Git guide to be a
useful cheatsheet.</p>
