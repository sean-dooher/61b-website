<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>


<p>Tablut is one of the family of <em>tafl</em> (or <em>hnefatafl</em>) games: Nordic and Celtic
strategy games played on checkered boards between two asymmetric armies.
These are ancient games,
possibly related to the Roman game <em>ludus latrunculorum</em>,
that were generally displaced by chess in the 12th century.
Tablut is a variant from Lapland (the northernmost region of Finland).
The detailed rules of these games are generally disputed; tablut, having
survived into the 1700s, is perhaps best documented (by none other than
Carl Linnaeus, the fellow responsible for our state animal being known as
<em>Ursus arctos californicus</em> and our state trees as
<em>Sequoia sempervirens</em>  and <em>Sequoiadendron giganteum</em> in scientific circles).
However, his account is itself incomplete and additional confusion resulted from
the later mistranslation of his manuscript from Latin.  Therefore, any of you
familiar with modern reconstructions of the
game should not expect that our version will be identical to yours.</p>

<p>Tablut is played on a 9x9 checkerboard between a set of 9 white pieces and 16
black pieces.  The middle square is called the <em>throne</em> (or castle).
One of the white pieces is the king, and the others, his
guards, are known as <em>Swedes</em>. The white side wins if
the king reaches one of the edges of the board.  The black pieces are known
as <em>Muscovites</em> (referring to the Grand Duchy of Moscow).  Their aim is to
capture the king before he reaches the edge of the board.

<blockquote><p><strong>Figure 1.</strong> On the left: a Tablut board showing the standard numbering of
squares, and the initial placement of the pieces.
On the right: the board that results after the three moves <code>i6&#x2d;g</code>, <code>d5&#x2d;7</code>,
<code>i4&#x2d;g</code> (the last move is a capture).
</center></p></blockquote>

<p>All pieces move like chess rooks: any number of squares orthogonally 
(horizontally or
vertically).  Pieces may not jump over each other or land on top of another piece.
No piece other than the king may land on the throne, although any piece may
pass through it when it is empty. The black (Muscovite) side goes first.</p>

<p>A piece other than the king is captured when, as a result of an enemy move,
the piece is enclosed on two opposite sides (again orthogonally) by <em>hostile
squares</em>.  A square is hostile if it contains an enemy piece, or if it is the
throne square and is empty (that is, it is hostile to both white and black
pieces).  The occupied throne is also hostile to white pieces when three of
the four squares surrounding it are occupied by black pieces.
Captures result only as a result of enemy moves;
a piece may move so as to land between two enemy pieces without being
captured.  A single move can capture up to three pieces.</p>

<p>The king is captured like other pieces except when he is on the throne square
or on one of the four squares orthogonally adjacent to the throne.  In that
case, the king is captured only when surrounded on all four sides by hostile
squares (of which the empty throne may be one).</p>

<p>A side also loses when it has no legal moves on its turn, or if its move returns
the board to a previous position (same pieces in the same places and the same
side to move).  As a result, there are no drawn games.</p>


<h2 id="notation">Notation</h2>


<p>A square is denoted by a column letter followed by a row number (as in
<code>e4</code>). Columns are enumerated from left to right with letters a through i.
Rows are enumerated from the bottom to the top with numbers 1 through 9.
An entire move then consists of the starting square, a hyphen, and 
the ending row (if vertical) or column (if horizontal).
Thus, <code>b3&#x2d;6</code> means "Move from b3 to b6" and <code>b3&#x2d;f</code> means "Move from b3 to f3."</p>


<h2 id="commands">Commands</h2>


<p>When running from the command line, the program will accept the following
commands, which may be preceded by whitespace.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>new</strong>: End any game in progress, clear the board to its initial position,
  and set the current player to white.</li>
  <li>A move in the format described in <a href="#notation">Notation</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>seed</strong> <em>N</em>: If the AIs are using random numbers for move selection, this
  command seeds their random-number generator with the integer <em>N</em>. Given
  the same seed and the same opposing moves, an AI should always make the same
  moves.  This feature makes games reproducible.</li>
  <li><strong>auto</strong> <em>C</em>: Make the <em>C</em> player an automated player.
  Here, <em>C</em> is "black" or "white", case-insensitive.</li>
  <li><strong>manual</strong> <em>C</em>: Make the <em>C</em> player a human player (entering moves as
  manual commands).</li>
  <li><strong>limit</strong> <em>N</em>: Make <em>N</em> be the maximum number of moves that a
  player may make during the current game.  A player loses if
  the game has not ended by the time he must make his $(N+1)$st move.
  The command is in error if either player has already made at least <em>N</em> moves.
  The move limit is removed by a <strong>new</strong> command.
  (A move limit is not a normal provision of Tablut; we've added it for testing
  convenience so that we can test whether a program can find a forced win within
  a given number of moves.)</li>
  <li><p><strong>dump</strong>: Print the current state of the board in <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the
  following format:</p>

<pre><code>===
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B B B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; W &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
  B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; W &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B
  B B W W K W W B B
  B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; W &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; W &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
  &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d; B B B &#x2d; &#x2d; &#x2d;
===</code></pre>

  <p>Here, <code>K</code> denotes the king, <code>W</code> another white piece (Swede) and 
  <code>B</code> a black piece (Muscovite).
  You must not use the <code>===</code> lines for any other output).</p></li>
  <li><strong>quit</strong>: Exit the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free any other commands you think might be nice.</p>


<h2 id="output">Output</h2>


<p>When an AI plays, it should print out each move that it makes using
exactly the format</p>

<pre><code> * a1&#x2d;4</code></pre>

<p>(with asterisk shown).
Do not print these lines out for a manual player's moves.</p>

<p>When one side wins, the program should print out one of</p>

<pre><code> * White wins.
 * Black wins.</code></pre>

<p>(also with periods) as appropriate.  Do not use the <code>*</code> character in any
other output you produce.</p>

<p>You may prompt a manual player for input using the form</p>

<pre><code>...&gt;</code></pre>

<p>where "..." may be any text.  The grading scripts will discard any text
from the beginning of a line up to a <code>&gt;</code> character.</p>


<h2 id="your-task">Your Task</h2>


<p>Your job is to write a program to play Tablut.  To run it in text mode,
use the command</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main</code></pre>

<p>to enter commands from the terminal or use</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main INPUT</code></pre>

<p>to feed it commands from file INPUT.</p>

<p>The AI in your program should be capable of finding a win that is within 4
moves.
Experiment a bit to see what works.  The autograder will allow 3 minutes for
a fully automated game.</p>

<p>The GUI  is an optional (extra credit) part of this project.  We will
actually do automatic testing only on the commands</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main INPUT</code></pre>


<h2 id="staff-program">Staff Program</h2>


<p>The <code>staff&#x2d;tablut</code> program on the instructional machines runs our
solution to the project.  This version has additional bells and
whistles that you are <strong><em>not</em></strong> required to duplicate.  It is
<strong><em>not</em></strong> the standard for this project, just as example of a
solution.  In particular, your GUI (if you do it) need not look
anything like ours.  The autograder will use this program in some of
its tests to check your program's output.</p>


<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>


<p>We have only provided a token <code>UnitTest</code> file; you can add additional
unit test files and list them in <code>UnitTest</code> so that they all get run
by</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.UnitTest</code></pre>

<p>(which is what <code>make check</code> does).</p>

<p>We have provided two simple integration tests in the <code>testing</code> subdirectory.
They are certainly not adequate to test your program.  Be warned, we will not
run the autograder until near the deadline; <strong><em>DO NOT RELY ON THE AUTOGRADER FOR
YOUR TESTING!</em></strong></p>

<p>The integration test program, <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code>, feeds commands to one or two 
running programs and passes appropriate moves from one to the other, allowing
you to test your program and to test it against another program (such as the 
staff version).
To run <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code>, you'll use</p>

<pre><code>python3 testing/test&#x2d;tablut TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in</code></pre>

<p>to run <code>TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in</code> through your program and</p>

<pre><code>python3 testing/test&#x2d;tablut TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in TESTFILE&#x2d;2.in</code></pre>

<p>to run two programs simultaneously so that each one sends all of its AI's moves
(such as "<code>*</code>&nbsp;<code>i4</code>&#x2011<code>g</code>"
as described previously) to the other program.
(Replace "TESTFILE" with the actual name of your test file.)</p>

<p>Each <code>.in</code> and input file should start with a Unix-style command for
running a program preceded by "<code>#*</code>", such as</p>

<pre><code> #* java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main</code></pre>

<p>(You will probably use just the command command above; 
the autograder will sometimes
replace it with an invocation of <code>staff&#x2d;tablut</code>.)
The rest of the <code>.in</code> file is fed to this program as the standard
input, except for lines that start with "<code>#*</code>" in the first column,
which are special instructions to the testing script.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The command <code>#*time</code> <em>MOVE</em> <em>GAME</em> puts a time limit of <em>MOVE</em> seconds
  on each move in a game and <em>GAME</em> seconds for one side's moves in an
  entire game (i.e., an entire sequence of moves controlled
  by one of the <code>move/win</code> commands below).</li>
  <li>The command <code>#*move</code> means "wait for the program to output an AI move,
  and then continue with
  the script."  When used with the two-argument form of <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code>, it
  also sends this
  move as input to the other program.</li>
  <li>The command <code>#*move/win</code> is intended for use when both players are AIs,
  and means
  "wait for the program to output a complete sequence of AI moves,
  followed by "<code>* ... wins.</code>"
  It does not print either the moves or the "win" message.</li>
  <li>The command <code>#*move/win+</code> is the same as <code>#*move/win</code>, but also prints
  the "<code>* ... wins.</code>" message.</li>
  <li>The command <code>#*win+</code> waits for a "<code>* ... wins.</code>" message from the program
  and prints it.</li>
  <li>All lines that don't start with <code>#*</code> are sent to the program being tested.</li>
</ul>

<p>A few other commands apply only to the two-argument form of <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code>.
They are intended to
allow two programs to play each other.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The command <code>#*remote move/win</code> means "Wait for an AI move from the other
  program, give it to
  this program, then execute a <code>#*move</code> command. Repeat
  until one side sends a win message. Do not print the moves or win message.</li>
  <li>The command <code>#*remote move/win+</code> is the same as <code>#*remote move/win</code>,
  but prints the "win" message.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea with these two commands is that one of the two scripts will,
at a certain point,
contain the commands</p>

<pre><code>#*move
#*remote move/win</code></pre>

<p>and the other will contain</p>

<pre><code>#*remote move/win</code></pre>

<p>so that the first sends a move from its AI to the other program, which
then waits for a response
from its AI to send back, and so forth.</p>

<p>For the <code>remote</code> commands, both programs should generate "wins" messages,
and <tt>test&#x2011;tablut</tt> will check
that they are the same.</p>

<p>The <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code> script throws out any other output from either program
except for properly
formatted board dumps, as are supposed to be produced by the <strong>dump</strong> command
described previously.   You can see all the output by running it with</p>

<pre><code> python3 testing/test&#x2d;tablut &#x2d;&#x2d;verbose TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code> python3 testing/test&#x2d;tablut &#x2d;&#x2d;verbose TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in TESTFILE&#x2d;2.in</code></pre>

<p>which will show all the commands sent to each program and all their output.</p>

<p>The <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code> program will report an error if a program hangs or
times out, or if it exits abnormally (with an exception or an exit
code other than 0).  Finally, if there is a file <code>TESTFILE&#x2d;1.std</code> or
<code>TESTFILE&#x2d;2.std</code>, <code>test&#x2d;tablut</code> will check it against the output 
from the program for
<code>TESTFILE&#x2d;1.in</code> (likewise for <code>TESTFILE&#x2d;2.std</code> against the output for
<code>TESTFILE&#x2d;2.in</code>).</p>


<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h2>


<p>First get your program working, and then, if you feel the urge,
try the extra-credit GUI (Graphical User Interface).
If you do, the option</p>

<pre><code>java &#x2d;ea tablut.Main &#x2d;&#x2d;display</code></pre>

<p>should create the GUI.  If you don't implement the GUI, this option should
cause your program to exit with a non-zero code via <code>System.exit(2)</code>.
Your GUI does <strong><em>not</em></strong> have to look at all like ours.</p>


<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>


<p>Your final work must be your own, but especially on this project,
feel free to get together with other
students to discuss ideas and plan strategies.  Of course, you should
always feel free to consult your TA or me.</p>

<p>The board is an obvious place to start.  We have provided suggestions
for methods that you can use if you want, but you are not required to
do so. We have structured the skeleton so that the different kinds of
player (ordinary human at the keyboard using text commands, AI, or
human using a GUI) are represented as different subtypes of a type
<code>Player</code>, an example of how using OOP can cut down on pervasive
conditional tests for types of player.</p>
