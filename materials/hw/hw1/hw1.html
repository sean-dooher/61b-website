<h2 id="a-introduction-to-junit">A. Introduction to JUnit</h2>


<p>In lab 1, you saw an example of <em>unit testing</em>, the testing of individual
components (methods) of a program.  To do this, you write extra code that
is not used in the actual operation of your program, but is
instead intended for use during development to find and localize bugs as
they happen.</p>

<p>We'll rely on a widely used testing package called
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit">JUnit</a>. Your instructor has been
quoted as saying "It is one of the most poorly documented bunches of Java
code I've seen," so we'll jump right into using it, rather than going to
any official documentation.</p>

<p>As with lab1, start this homework by using the following commands in your
local <code>repo</code> directory.</p>

<pre><code>git fetch shared
git merge shared/hw1 &#x2d;m &quot;start HW 1&quot;
git push</code></pre>

<p>You'll receive a hw1 folder with three subdirectories: <code>Arithmetic</code>,
<code>CompoundInterest</code>, <code>IntList</code>.  Arithmetic contains a fully implemented
sample program and JUnit test, and the other two folders are programs that
you'll need to implement for this homework.</p>

<p>Open the hw1 folder in IntelliJ using <strong>Import Project</strong> or <strong>File > New >
Project from Existing Sources...</strong>, and not with the Open command. Remember
to import the libraries in <code>cs61b&#x2d;software/lib</code> by going under <strong>File > Project
Structure > Libraries</strong> and clicking on the green plus button.</p>


<h4 id="ad-hoc-testing-in-java">Ad-hoc Testing in Java</h4>


<p>Let's start by examining the already completed contents of the
<code>Arithmetic</code> folder. In it, you'll see a very simple arithmetic package in
a file named <code>Arithmetic.java</code>, along with a couple of test clients named
<code>ArithmeticTest.java</code> and <code>ArithmeticJunitTest.java</code>. In case you're
unfamiliar with the term, the program X is said to be a <em>client</em> of the
program Y if X uses any data or methods from program Y. In this case, the
purpose of our two clients will be to test the class <code>Arithmetic</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>ArithmeticTest</code> test client is an ad-hoc test written entirely from
scratch.  Don't try to understand the details or even the flow of the
test, just <em>briefly</em> look at the overall structure, noting the length and
the nature of the methods implemented.</p>

<p>You'll observe that the source code is 56 lines long, and has to manually
implement common tasks like approximate floating point comparison,
tallying of tests passed, and provision of useful test output for the
human user. There are various ways to run the tests.
Try running the file <code>ArithmeticTest.java</code> in IntelliJ. You should
see the output:</p>

<pre><code>product OK.
sum FAILS.</code></pre>

<p>On Unix or MacOS, another alternative is to use the command line to compile
the program with <code>make</code> (or compile <code>ArithmeticTest.java</code> with <code>javac</code> on Windows)
and then run it with <code>java ArithmeticTest</code> (or do both with <code>make check</code>).
This should give the same output.</p>


<h4 id="junit-testing">JUnit Testing</h4>


<p>The JUnit package does a lot of the kludgy work for us, avoiding
implementation of common testing tasks such as those we saw in
ArithmeticTest. Basic JUnit tests tend to leverage a few key components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A set of methods with names like <code>assertTrue</code> and <code>assertEquals</code> that
  perform some simple test and cause an error if it fails.</li>
  <li>A number of "annotations," such as <code>@Test</code>, which marks a method as
  being a unit test.</li>
  <li>Various main testing routines that examine
  specified classes at execution time and call all of the methods in
  them that are annotated to be tests,
  i.e. those methods with <code>@Test</code> proceeding their definition.</li>
</ol>

<p>As an example, look at the <code>Arithmetic/ArithmeticJUnitTest.java</code> JUnit-
based arithmetic test client:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It starts with two lines that begin with <code>import</code>.
  These lines just mean that our program will be able to utilize
  shorthand names for items in the JUnit libraries: for example,
  <code>assertEquals</code> rather than <code>org.junit.Assert.assertEquals</code>.</li>
  <li>Some of the methods have <code>@Test</code> right above their declaration.
  This is an example of an
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations">annotation</a>
  which attaches various "metadata" to a Java entity that
  is then accessible by the Java program itself.
  As an example, the JUnit framework is a Java program that looks for methods
  that have the @Test annotation, and then for each such method found,
  executes that method.</li>
  <li>The main method performs the task
  <code>System.exit(ucb.junit.textui.runClasses(ArithmeticJUnitTest.class))</code>.
  This just means that every method in the class
  <code>ArithmeticJUnitTest</code> that has the annotation @Test is to be run, and
  the results accumulated and reported.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this homework, you'll write your own such JUnit tests.</p>

<p>There are a number of advantages to using JUnit-based testing over the
ad-hoc test above: the JUnit test is only 29 lines long, is easier to read,
and avoids implementation of common tasks like approximate floating point
comparisons, and so forth. Furthermore, when run, it also provides us with
a more useful output for deubgging purposes:</p>

<pre><code>Time: 0.018
There were 1 failures:
1) testSum(ArithmeticJUnitTest)
expected:&amp;lt;11.0&amp;gt; but was:&amp;lt;30.0&amp;gt;
at ArithmeticJUnitTest.testSum:14 (ArithmeticJUnitTest.java)
Ran 2 tests. 1 failed.</code></pre>

<p>JUnit tests are easy to write once you learn the basics and give
you useful output, straight out of the box.  We hope you'll grow to love
them.</p>


<h2 id="b-compound-interest">B. Compound Interest</h2>


<center><a href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/einstein/interest.asp">"Compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe." - Albert Einstein (maybe)</a></center>

<p>Investment income grows faster than inflation, and thus the choices you
make about investment at an early age can make a huge difference in how
much money you'll have when you retire. In this homework problem, we'll
build some code to explore this idea, and we'll also get some practice
with the idea of test-driven-development using JUnit.</p>

<p>Go into the CompoundInterest folder, and you should see
CompoundInterest.java, CompoundInterestTest.java, and Makefile. Each of
these files is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(computer_programming)">skeleton</a>.
Your goal in this problem is to fill in all the methods in both
<code>.java</code> files to match the comments.</p>

<p>As you work, try to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development methodology</a>
where
you do things in the following order: Write the test. Run the test (you
should fail). Write the code. Run the test (you should pass). Refactor if
desired and if so, re-run test.</p>

<p>To run the tests in <code>CompoundInterestTest.java</code>, select the file and click on
<strong>Run > Run 'CompoundInterestTest'</strong> in IntelliJ. You'll see
that the unit tests report that all tests have passed. This is bad,
because it means that our starter test is garbage, as it believes our
incomplete CompoundInterest.java is flawless.</p>

<p>By the way,
you can also run the starter test from the command line like this (if you have
<code>make</code> installed):</p>

<pre><code>$ make check</code></pre>

<p>which (as you can see from <code>Makefile</code>) runs the command</p>

<pre><code>java CompoundInterestTest</code></pre>

<p>after first making sure that <code>CompoundInterestTest.class</code> is up to date.</p>

<p>The rest of this part of the homework describes a suggested path to
completion. You do not have to follow it, but it is recommended. If you
set off on your own from this point on Part 1, please give the test-first
approach a fair shake. We believe it will save you grief in the future.</p>


<h4 id="testnumyears"><code>testNumYears</code></h4>


<p>Start this homework by opening <code>CompoundInterestTest.java</code> and
<code>CompoundInterest.java</code> in your text editor of choice. In
<code>CompoundInterestTest.java</code>, you'll see a bunch of tests you're supposed to
implement. Using <code>Arithmetic/ArithmeticJUnitTest.java</code>
as a guide, edit the <code>testNumYears</code>
method so that it acts as a good test of whether or not <code>numYears</code> obeys
the specifications given in the documentation comments in
<code>CompoundInterest.java</code>. Two <code>assertEquals</code> statements are probably good
enough. We're throwing you right in the deep end with a bunch of sharks
and megalodons here, so don't hesitate to ask for help (in lab, office
hours, piazza, HKN, etc.).</p>

<p>Useful fact: <code>numYears</code> returns an int, you don't need to specify a
tolerance when you write your assertEquals statements (since we don't have
to worry about rounding error when comparing integers).</p>

<p>After you've created better tests, run them, and your
<code>numYears</code> method should now fail the test.  Ironically, this shows that
the test is working!  In fact, experienced programmers get suspicious when
they write bunches of tests that <em>don't</em> fail out of the box.</p>


<h4 id="numyears"><code>numYears</code></h4>


<p>Now edit <code>numYears</code> in CompoundInterest.java so that it passes the test.
It should be a straightforward method to write.</p>

<p>While it might be a little silly to write a unit test for something as
trivial as numYears, once you get used to JUnit testing, the time taken to
write a test becomes so small that you may as well write at least a basic
test for every method.</p>


<h4 id="futurevalue"><code>futureValue</code></h4>


<p>Repeat the exercise from before, but now with the <code>testFutureValue</code> and <code>futureValue</code> methods. Write the test first, and verify that it compiles and fails before moving on to writing <code>futureValue</code>. Feel free to use the example in the documentation comments as one of your JUnit tests.</p>

<p>Make sure your test includes negative appreciation rates.</p>


<h4 id="futurevaluereal"><code>futureValueReal</code></h4>


<p>Now we'll write a method that computes the future value of an appreciating
(or depreciating) asset if we take into account inflation. Having a
million dollars today is very different than what it will be in 60 years.</p>

<p>To correct for inflation, one simply considers how much an asset would be
worth if it hypothetically depreciated at the inflation rate for the
appropriate time frame. For example, if we want to know how much 1,000,000
dollars will be worth in 40 years and we assume the inflation rate will be
3 percent over the next 40 years, we'd see they'd be worth $\$1,000,000 *
(0.97)^{40}$ or $295,712.28 in 2019 dollars. Not bad, but not quite so
impressive.</p>

<p>Again, start by writing the tests, then run the tests to see they
successfully compile and fail, and then finally write code for
<code>futureValueReal</code> that passes the tests.</p>


<h4 id="printdollarfv-and-compoundinterest-main"><code>printDollarFV and CompoundInterest.main</code></h4>


<p>Using what we've written so far, we can answer our first interesting
question: How much money is future-you losing everytime present-you spends
a dollar? They say a penny saved is a penny earned, but this is only true
if you're a bad investor. In fact, each penny is worth many pennies.</p>

<p>Try running CompoundInterest's main function, and you'll see that it tells
you something that is clearly not true (assuming that we don't go through
an apocalyptic event that eradicates the value of all money). Update the
printDollarFV function so that it gives you a correct result.</p>

<p>In case you're curious about the parametric assumptions made in main, see
<a href="#regarding-investment-assumptions">the end of this assignment</a> for more.</p>


<h4 id="totalsavings-and-totalsavingsreal"><code>totalSavings</code> and <code>totalSavingsReal</code></h4>


<p>Another more interesting question: How much money will you have if you set
aside some fixed amount each year? To lay the groundwork, repeat the same
exercise as above for <code>totalSavings</code> and <code>totalSavingsReal.</code></p>


<h4 id="printsavingsfv-and-compoundinterest-main"><code>printSavingsFV</code> and <code>CompoundInterest.main</code></h4>


<p>As the final step in this assignment, edit <code>printSavingsFV</code> so that it
gives you useful information about how much money you'll have if you save
<code>perYear</code> dollars every year until <code>targetYear</code>.</p>


<h2 id="c-intlists">C. IntLists</h2>


<p>Test-driven development particularly shines when you have a task whose
outcome is conceptually easy to understand but hard to implement. Let's
try out the TDD methodology in the context of recursive data structures.</p>

<p>In the <code>IntList</code> folder, you'll see an implementation of the <code>IntList</code> class
as discussed in class during lecture 4. Your task for this problem is to
add four new methods for manipulating IntLists: <code>dcatenate</code>, <code>subtail</code>,
<code>sublist</code>, and <code>dsublist</code>. The desired behavior for these functions is
given in the starter code for IntList.</p>

<p>Start by implementing <code>testDcatenate</code> in IntListTest.java. Run the test
(in IntelliJ or with <code>make check</code>) to
ensure it fails (since you haven't implemented <code>dcatenate</code> yet).</p>

<p>After writing <code>testDcatenate</code>, move on to the <code>dcatenate</code> method in
IntListTest. You're welcome to use either iterative or recursive code in
your solution, but we recommend a recursive approach.</p>

<p>Once you've completed <code>testDcatenate</code> and <code>dcatenate</code>, repeat this process
for the next three methods of IntList.</p>

<p>When you're done with all four tests and <code>IntList</code> methods, and have properly
committed them (<code>git commit &#x2d;a</code> ...), submit them:</p>

<pre><code>git tag hw1&#x2d;0       # or hw1&#x2d;1, hw1&#x2d;2, for resubmissions
git push
git push &#x2d;&#x2d;tags</code></pre>

<p>This is required in order to get credit for the homework.</p>


<h2 id="d-regarding-investment-assumptions-extra">D. Regarding Investment Assumptions (Extra)</h2>


<p>We were seemingly quite optimistic in our assumptions, expecting a 10%
yearly return and a 3% inflation rate. This rate of return was assuming
that you've invested your money in what is known as an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund">index fund</a>. Index funds
have become particularly popular in recent years, and for good reason.
Over the past half century, an investment portfolia that simply consists
of every single company in the S&amp;P 500 would have earned an effective
interest rate of 10% per year (the actual returns are highly volatile, but
averaged over a very long period of time it comes to about 10%).</p>

<p>This seemingly naive (and easy to automate!) strategy of simply investing
in a large number of large companies actually does quite well.
In contrast, there are also
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_management">managed funds</a>,
which are steered by analysts who try to beat the market, i.e. try to do
better than the naive strategy of investing in the entire S&amp;P (or
similar).
Intriguingly, despite their highly capable employees, such
managed funds have traditionally been unable to beat managed funds in
performance (see
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/22/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/22stra.html?_r=0">this</a>,
for example). And
analysts don't work for free. If you invest in managed funds, the company
running it will take a cut that ends up making <a
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/business/mutfund/in-fund-expenses-tenths-of-a-point-mean-a-lot.html">a huge difference</a>
in your overall
investment payoff.</p>

<p>Caveat emptor: While the S&amp;P 500 has historically done quite well, the
stock markets of other nations <a href="https://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/?fileID=0E0A3525-EA60-2750-71CE20B5D14A7818">have not been quite so
lucky</a>.
It is entirely possible that we are experiencing a
phase shift in the American (and perhaps global) economy; those sweet
10% returns might evaporate for good, and who knows what sort of financial
dystopia we might find outselves in.</p>
