                        Hey! I'm Akshit, and I'm from Dublin, CA and am currently a third year EECS major. In my free time, I enjoy watching a ton of T.V., eating a ton of food, and finding new classes to take at the RSF. 61B is one of my favorite CS courses I've taken so far, and I hope it'll be yours too! Looking forward to a great semester.

                        Hi everyone, I'm a fourth year computer science major. I love watching shows on Netflix but never actually finishing entire seasons. Talk to me about the office and Arrested Development. After taking 61B I decided to jump ship from being pre-haas to intended CS. I really hope you'll enjoy this class as much as I did. I look forward to having an amazing semester with you all.

This is my third semester teaching 61B, and as excellent as the profs are, I find I learn even more from teaching you, the students, in section and office hours.

I spend most of my time training to become a master chef under the guidance of Gordon Ramsay and Binging with Babish, but in my free time I like playing video games, watching dog videos, and sleeping. Oh yeah I guess I do some classes and studying here and there too x_x

                        Hi there! I'm Fatema, and I'm a 3rd year from the Bay Area. CS61B is my favorite class and I'm super excited for you to experience it too! In my free time, you can find me hiking, watching Netflix, eating, or baking banana bread. Oh and I'm super obsessed with coffee. That means you will probably find me at any cafe or coffee shop around campus. If you ever see me make sure to say hi!

                        Hi! I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science. Outside of academics, one of my main hobbies is wushu (Chinese martial arts). I also love spontaneous adventures, or more specifically, I have an unhealthy obsession with going to the beach. Please feel free to contact me about anything and everything!
