<h2 id="a-how-not-to-report-a-bug">A. How Not to Report a Bug</h2>


<p>Every now and then, you will inevitably run into a problem with an
assignment that you can't figure out.  If it is simply a matter of not
understanding some aspect of Java or some quirk of our support
software, you can ask a question on Piazza. But when it involves the
code you have written for an assignment or project, Piazza is just not
the way to go.  First, you'll be posting information (such as your
answers) that is intended to be kept to yourself.  Second, Piazza just
isn't cut out for posting large pieces of code in a form that others
can easily understand.</p>

<p>In addition, there is the question of just what constitutes a proper bug report.
Here, for example, is a (redacted) Piazza post from a student:</p>

<blockquote><p>I'm trying to use HW0 for my java file and class name but it seems
like I cannot compile (I know how to get to this point and I've
passed tests using other names). I'm wondering why HW0.java
with a class named HW0 did not work.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, we can tell that the student had a compilation problem of some sort, but
we can't tell from this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What precisely was in HW0.java.</li>
  <li>What command was used to compile it.</li>
  <li>From what directory that command was issued.</li>
  <li>Where HW0.java was relative to that directory.</li>
  <li>What error message(s) resulted.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, no rational person would ever expect anyone to be able to answer this
question!  In fact, the issues listed above are not exhaustive.  One might need
to know.</p>

<ul>
  <li>What version of Java was being used.</li>
  <li>On what operating system.</li>
  <li>What the CLASSPATH was.</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.</p>

<p>Nor is this example the worst we've seen.  There are many reports
that amount simply to "Why does my program not work?" where we
can't even tell what "doesn't work" means (Doesn't compile?  Gets an exception
when executed?  Produces the wrong answer?).</p>

<p>Sometimes, a student will attempt to be, in effect, <em>too</em> helpful.
Typically, this involves posting a carefully trimmed snippet of code
that he assumes is the source of the problem, or giving a blow-by-blow account
of various things tried in order to find or fix the problem.  Again,
we find in general
that such attempts almost always manage to leave out the vital details that
are actually needed to answer the question.</p>


<h2 id="b-using-git-bug">B. Using Git-bug</h2>


<p>To make the process of bug reporting more productive, we've developed a
procedure that (we hope) makes it easy to get us all the information we need
to address your problems with labs, homeworks, and projects.   First, to make
sure that your report includes all the source code we need, we have added
a hook to the Git repository you use for managing and submitting your work
that allows you to label certain commits as "buggy".  By tagging
and submitting an entire
commit, you are much less likely to leave out the important (i.e., erroneous)
parts of your code.</p>

<p>The code alone, however, is not enough.  We must also know what problem you
are having with it and&mdash;most importantly&mdash;how we can reproduce the problem
in order to see it ourselves.  This in turn means at least telling us
<em>exactly</em> what commands you enter to compile and run the program, what results
you see, and how they differ from the results you expect.</p>

<p>To make this process convenient, we've developed a Python 3 script
called <code>git&#x2d;bug</code>, which is available on the instructional machines, and which
you can also import to your home computer and run there.  To use it, first
make sure that you have committed (via git) all your current work so that we
see what you see.  The command <code>git status</code> should report no untracked files or
uncommitted changes.   Be sure to include any test input files you use
(yes, testing files should also be part of your repository).</p>

<p>Now create a file with your favorite editor (let's call it <code>error.txt</code>
here).  containing the other data we need to understand your issue.
Cut and paste <a href="./gitbug-template.txt">this template</a> as a guide for
what to include.  The file does not have to be in your repository.</p>

<p>Finally, submit your bug with</p>

<pre><code>  git&#x2d;bug ASSGN ERROR&#x2d;FILE</code></pre>

<p>replacing <code>ASSGN</code> with the name of the assignment (e.g., <code>hw0</code>) and
<code>ERROR&#x2d;FILE</code> with the name of the file you created above (e.g., <code>error.txt</code>).
Optionally, you can leave off these two command-line arguments and the
script will prompt you for them.  If you are not on the instructional machines,
you are likely to have to run <code>git&#x2d;bug</code> explicitly with Python, as in</p>

<pre><code>  python3 &lt;directory containing git&#x2d;bug script&gt;/git&#x2d;bug ASSGN ERROR&#x2d;FILE</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>  python &lt;directory containing git&#x2d;bug script&gt;/git&#x2d;bug ASSGN ERROR&#x2d;FILE</code></pre>

<p>depending on what Python3 is called on your machine.</p>
