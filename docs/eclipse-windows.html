<font size="+1">
</font><p><font size="+1">Eclipse is the IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) that we will be using to write and execute Java programs.
It is available to multiple platforms. Here are the instructions for
installing Eclipse and anything else that you need for this class.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Install the following tools before getting started:
</font></p><ol>
<font size="+1"><li><p>JDK 1.6. The current release of JDK (Java
Development Kit) is 1.6. It is made available by Sun. There are
different updates, and you only need to install the lastest update
(update 7 at the time when this page is written). It can be downloaded
from here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/?intcmp=1281" target="_blank">Java SE Downloads</a>.
Choose "JDK 6 Update 7" to download and select your operating system in
the new page. Install it after downloading. If you choose the default
path for the installation, please verify that <code>javac.exe</code> and <code>java.exe</code> are available at <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_07\bin</code>. If the installer has not added the above path to your environment, add it in the "Properties" dialog from "My Computer".</p></li>
<li><p>Eclipse 3.4. Eclipse is available at the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Eclipse download servers</a>.
From the several available packages, please choose Eclipse IDE for Java
Developers (148 MB). Select the appropriate platform under download links and
download it. The
downloaded file has name "eclipse-java-juno-win32.zip". Extract to
a path that you like, say <code>C:\CS61B</code>, and you will see a subdirectory called <code>eclipse</code> with a program <code>eclipse.exe</code>.
</p></li><li>We will be using Subversion to commit code to the
instructional servers. Subversive is the plugin for Eclipse that
supports using Subversion in it. It does not come with the Eclipse
package, so we have to install it manually.<p></p>

<p>Start Eclipse by running <code>eclipse.exe</code>. It will ask you a location to the workspace. You may choose <code>C:\CS61B\workspace</code>
for now. From the main menu, choose "Help" &#8594; "Software Updates". In the
popup dialog, choose the "Available Software" tab and click "Add Site"
to add the following sites one by one:</p>

<p><code><strike>http://download.eclipse.org/technology/subversive/0.7/update-site/</strike></code><br><code><strike>http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/update-site/</strike></code><br><code><font color="#008000">http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/ganymede-site/</font></code><br><font color="#008000">(Refer to <a href="http://www.polarion.com/products/svn/subversive.php?src=eclipseproject" target="_blank">this webpage</a> for up-to-date information about Eclipse update sites.)</font></p>

<p>After that, expand the node with the <strike>second</strike> URL as its name, and
check "Subversive SVN Connectors". Click "Install..." and follow the
steps thereafter. Eclipse will automatically figure out other packages
that need to be installed as dependencies of "Subversive SVN
Connectors", and install all of them. Restart Eclipse when prompted and
our programming environment is ready.
</p>

<p><font color="#008000">For those who are not able to access the Eclipse update site, follow these steps to perform a manual Subversive installation:<code>plugins</code> directory of your Eclipse installation:
<ol>
  <li><p>Download <code><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/subversive/archive/Subversive-incubation-0.7.1.I20080612-1500.zip" target="_blank">Subversive-incubation-0.7.1.I20080612-1500.zip</a></code> from the Eclipse download site.</p></li>
  <li><p>Extract all the .jar files in the <code>plugins</code> path of the zip file to the <code>plugins</code> directory of your Eclipse installation.</p></li>
  <li><p>Download <code><a href="http://www.polarion.org/projects/subversive/download/eclipse/2.0/ganymede-site/plugins/org.polarion.eclipse.team.svn.connector.svnkit15_2.0.1.I20080612-1500.jar">org.polarion.eclipse.team.svn.connector.svnkit15_2.0.1.I20080612-1500.jar</a></code> and place it in the <code>plugins</code> directory of your Eclipse installation.</p></li>
</ol>
(This manual installation instruction is not supposed to work all the time and it may break your Eclipse installation.)
</font></p>
</li></font></ol>
<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">Once the programming environment is ready, we can
create a project and write some code. But before we do that, we have to
set up Subversion so that we can check our code into the instructional
servers:
</font></p><ol>
<font size="+1"><li><p>In Eclipse, choose "Window" &#8594; "Open Perspective" &#8594; "Other...". In the dialog, choose "SVN Repository Exploring".</p></li>
<li><p>Choose "File" &#8594; "New" &#8594; "Repository Location" from the menu, and
enter your account information.  Copy your private SSH key (stored on the 
instructional machines in <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>) into some secure
location on your home machine (readable only by you).  
<li><p>In the "New Repository Location" dialog, fill in the following URL in the "General" tab:</p>
<p><code>svn+ssh://torus.cs.berkeley.edu/&lt;YOURLOGIN&gt;</code></p>
<li><p>In the "Authentication" group, use <code>cs61b-ta</code> as the user name, and leave the "Password" field blank.</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to the "SSH Settings" tab and choose the "Private Key"
radio button. In the "File" box, enter the location of the SSH private
key file that you copied from the instructional machines.
Leave the "Passphrase" box blank, since we are not using passphrases on these
keys. 
<li><p>When you click the "Finish" button, you will see the new repository listed in the "SVN Repositories" window.</p></li>
<li><p>Expand the repository and you will see a "trunk" node, a "tags"
node, and more. Right click on "trunk" and choose "Find/Check Out
As...". Click "Finish" in the new dialog, and choose "Java Project"
under "Java" in the next dialog. You need to give your project a name.
Let's call it <code>cs61b</code>. In the same dialog as you enter the
project name, choose "Use project folder as root for sources and class
files" so that Eclipse does not separate the source and the compiled
binary code into different subdirectories of the project.</p></li>
<li><p>When you click "Finish" and return to the Java prespective, you will see and your <code>cs61b</code> project.</p></li>
</font></ol>
<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">We can now write a <code>HelloWorld</code> program and commit it to the server.
</font></p><ol>
<font size="+1"><li><p>Right click on the <code>cs61b</code> project
and choose "New" &#8594; "Class". In the new dialog, enter "HelloWorld" in
the "Name" field and check "public static void main(String[] args)".
The following is generated in <code>HelloWorld.java</code> as the skeleton:
</p><pre>public class HelloWorld {
  /**
   * @param args
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // TODO Auto-generated method stub
  }
}</pre><p></p></li>
<li><p>Replace the contents of the <code>main</code> method (between the open and close brackets) with:</p>
<p><code>System.out.println("Hello World!");</code></p>
<p>Save the file. Eclipse will automatically compile the code in the
background as long as "Project" &#8594; "Build Automatically" is checked.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the run button from the tool bar (the one with a white
triangle in a green circle), or choose "Run" &#8594; "Run", or press
Ctrl+F11, to run the code. You will see "Hello World!" to be printed to
the console at the bottom of the Eclipse window.</p></li>
<li><p>To commit the code to the server, expand "cs61b" and "(default
package)" in "Package Explorer" so that you can see "HelloWorld.java".
Right click "HelloWorld.java" and choose "Team" &#8594; "Add to Version
Control...". Click "OK" in the new Dialog.</p></li>
<li><p>Right click the "cs61b" project and choose "Team" &#8594; "Commit...".
In the new dialog, enter a short comment (say, "My first program."). In
the same dialog, the resources updated locally are listed, such as
"HelloWorld.java", ".classpath" and ".project". Press "OK" to commit
all those files.</p></li>
</font></ol>
<p></p>

<p><font size="+1">We've now committed the <code>HelloWorld</code>
program into the SVN repository located on the instructional servers.
You will be able to check out the code on any of the machines that you
work on.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1"><font color="red">IMPORTANT: Make sure you commit
your code regularly. There is no harm committing your code often, even
though it is not executable yet or it contains bugs.</font></font></p>
