<h2 id="a-what-is-eclipse">A. What is Eclipse?</h2>


<p>Up through this point in your programming career, you've likely typed
your programs in a text editor such as Emacs, Vim, or Sublime Text.
I'd now like to introduce you to Eclipse, which is an IDE (integrated
development environment). For your purposes, you can think of an IDE
as a text editor with a bunch of extra fancy features.</p>

<p>Eclipse is a free and open source IDE built specifically for Java
development (though it can be adapted to work with other languages).</p>


<h4 id="why-use-eclipse">Why Use Eclipse?</h4>


<p>Don't write off Eclipse's "extra fancy features" as gimmicks; they are
quite powerful and can dramatically increase the efficiency of your
programming.</p>

<p>One of Eclipse's most immediately practical features is its automatic
error checking. Similar to Microsoft Word, it underlines errors in red
as you type:</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/error_underlining.png" alt="Error underlining"></p>

<p>As shown in the figure, you can even hover over the error to get a
description of it and suggested fixes!</p>

<p>Of course, Eclipse can't find every bug in your program, but it will
notify you of all errors that would be caught when compiling your
program (these are called <em>compile-time errors</em>). This is because
Eclipse is constantly and automatically compiling your program in the
background as you type it. That's right: using Eclipse you won't need
to compile your programs manually anymore! In fact, in order to run
your program, all you have to do is hit the green run button, and it
will run within Eclipse:</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/run_button.png" alt="Run button"></p>

<p>Eclipse has a ton of other useful features, but I'll introduce them to
you slowly so you don't get overwhelmed. I hope these two features
alone are compelling enough to convince you to use Eclipse. They
should greatly reduce your debugging time: no more compiling and
running your code again and again just to discover you made a tiny
error like misspelling a variable or forgetting a semicolon.</p>

<p>You're certainly not required to use Eclipse to type your programs in
this class. Although Eclipse has a lot of great features, it has so
many that there's a bit of a learning curve in using it, so feel free
to use Emacs or Vim if you prefer their simplicity. However, I
strongly recommend Eclipse. Personally, I've found it invaluable for
programming in Java. And, although you won't run into this problem so
much in 61b, I've found Eclipse absolutely essential for managing
larger projects.</p>

<p>I've written this document to help get you over the learning curve
faster. It's also meant to be a reference, so if you ever forget how
to do something you can return here and look it up.</p>

<p>Okay: if I've sold you on Eclipse, read on, and let's get it set-up!</p>


<h2 id="b-installation">B. Installation</h2>



<h4 id="on-the-lab-machines">On the lab machines</h4>


<p>Eclipse is already installed! Just type <code>eclipse</code> in the terminal to
start it up.</p>


<h4 id="on-ubuntu">On Ubuntu</h4>


<p>Just type <code>sudo apt&#x2d;get install eclipse</code> in the terminal to install.
Then type <code>eclipse</code> in the terminal afterward to start it up.</p>


<h4 id="on-mac-os-x">On Mac OS X</h4>


<p>Download the "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" from <a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">the eclipse
website</a>. Extract the archive and drag
the extracted <code>eclipse</code> folder into your Applications. If you'd like,
you can go into the <code>eclipse</code> folder and drag <code>Eclipse.app</code> into your
dock.</p>


<h4 id="on-other-operating-systems">On Other Operating Systems</h4>


<p>You're on your own. Hopefully you know how to install programs on your
computer. You'll want to visit <a href="https://eclipse.org/">the eclipse
website</a> and download Eclipse from there. Select
the one for Java, of course!</p>

<!-- FIXME?-->
Note: As of writing, Linux users should stick to Eclipse version 3.x
while Windows and Mac users should use Eclipse version 4.x. I use 3.x,
so if you're using 4.x it may be that your graphics look slightly
different from the ones in the pictures I post in this document. Don't
worry! It should basically work the same.


<h2 id="c-set-up-your-code">C. Set Up Your Code</h2>


<p>In Eclipse, all your code must be organized into <em>projects</em>, which you
can think of as folders that contain a bunch of related code. Projects
must then be further grouped into a <em>workspace</em>, which for now you can
think of as another folder. There are a lot of different opinions on
the best ways to organize workspaces and projects. However, for this
class, you're forced to use the structure of the git repo we gave you,
so let's adapt Eclipse to work with that structure. I believe the
cleanest way for you to do this is to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make the top level folder of your local git repo into a single
  workspace, and</li>
  <li>Make each of the assignment folders (lab1, lab2,
  lab3, hw1, etc.) into individual projects in that workspace</li>
</ul>

<p>As an example, let's get your lab1 code working in Eclipse.</p>


<h4 id="setting-up-lab1">Setting up lab1</h4>


<p>When you first open Eclipse, it'll ask you to choose a location for
your workspace. Select the folder of your local git repo. If you
already selected a different workspace on accident, no worries, just
go to <code>File &gt; Switch Workspace</code> and change it.</p>

<p>(If you accidentally set another workspace as your default, to change
the default go to <code>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Startup and
Shutdown &gt; Workspaces</code>. Then check <code>Prompt for workspace on startup</code>.
Then restart Eclipse, select the new workspace, and select the option
to make it default.)</p>

<p>In addition, the first time you open Eclipse you'll likely find a
screen that looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/welcome_screen.png" alt="Welcome screen"></p>

<p>Select <code>Workbench</code> to be taken to a screen that looks more like this:</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/editor.png" alt="Editor"></p>

<p>This is where we'll be doing most of our work.</p>

<p>Now let's try to edit code from lab1 in Eclipse. However, in order to
make use of all of Eclipse's features while typing, you'll first have
to add your code to a project. Go to <code>File &gt; New &gt; Java Project</code>. (If
you don't see this option exactly (e.g. you only see <code>Project</code> and not
<code>Java Project</code>), you may be in the wrong <em>perspective</em>. Try <code>Window &gt;
Open perspective &gt; Java</code>.)</p>

<p>A new window pops up. In <code>Project name</code>, type in <code>lab1</code>. Type it in
exactly with the name of the folder already on your computer. If you
do this, the remainder of the options for creating a project should
grey out. This is because you're creating a project out of an existing
folder, so there's nothing left to specify.</p>

<p>(Side note: If you want to create a new project and the folder doesn't
already exist (like if you're working on something that isn't a lab or
homework for this class), consider checking the option 'Use project
folder as root for sources and class files' instead of 'Create
separate folders for sources and class files'. Although this is not
the typical way that people organize Java files, this is what matches
the structure that this class uses, so it will be the most familiar to
you.)</p>


<h2 id="d-a-tour-of-eclipse">D. A Tour of Eclipse</h2>



<h4 id="opening-code">Opening Code</h4>


<p>All right! We should have your lab1 code all ready to go in Eclipse.
There's a lot on the screen, so let's go over what various things do.</p>

<p>On the left you should see something called the <em>package explorer</em> (if
it's not there, go to <code>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Package Explorer</code>).</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/package_explorer.png" alt="Package explorer"></p>

<p>The package explorer allows you to browse through and open all your
files in your projects. Expand the lab1 project, and the default
package. You should see your code. Click on it to open it up.</p>

<p>(Important: If you move around files outside of Eclipse (like using
the terminal), the package explore <em>won't</em> automatically update their
positions. You will have to refresh it. Right-click on the changed
project and select <code>Refresh</code>. (If you would prefer Eclipse to
automatically refresh, try <code>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt;
Workspace</code> and then change the refresh settings there.)</p>

<p>Now you can type stuff. Try making some deliberate errors to see if
Eclipse underlines them in red (maybe add a line at the top of main
that doesn't end in a semi-colon). If it does, it looks like you've
gotten things set-up right. If not, (and your code actually has an
error), there might be a problem.</p>


<h4 id="running-code">Running Code</h4>


<p>Now let's try running our code. Click on the green circle with an
arrow in it. If this doesn't work, try clicking on the little black
arrow next to it, then selecting <code>Run As &gt; Java Application</code>.</p>

<p>The following text should appear in a tab called the <em>console</em>:</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/console.png" alt="Console"></p>

<p>The console is where text that your program prints out appears.</p>

<p>(Side note: Both the console and the package explorer are known as
<em>views</em>. You can move them around the screen as you choose, minimize
them, maximize them, or lock them in place. If a view ever disappears
and you don't know how to get it back, you can always go to <code>Window &gt;
Show View</code> and then select it. There are buttons to open some of them
in the margins, too)</p>


<h4 id="command-line-arguments">Command Line Arguments</h4>


<p>The reason <code>Year.java</code> printed out <code>Please enter command line
arguments.</code> is that, well, we didn't enter any command line arguments.
Remember when we ran it from the terminal, we had to tell the program
which year we wanted to use. But how do we do this in Eclipse, if we
don't type anything when we run a program? It turns out there is a
separate menu for adding in command line arguments. Let's go check it
out now.</p>

<p>Click on the little black arrow next to the run button, and select
<code>Run Configurations...</code>. This will open up a new mini window. Click on
the <code>Arguments</code> tab, then in the <code>Program Arguments</code> section, type
your argument (for example, type in 2000). Now click <code>Apply</code>, and then
<code>Run</code>. It will run the program using that argument.</p>

<p><img src="eclipse_img/arguments.png" alt="Arguments"></p>

<p>What we just ran was equivalent to typing <code>java Year 2000</code> at the
terminal. But notice that we omitted <code>java</code> and the name of the
program <code>Year</code>. You must omit these when using Eclipse.</p>

<p>Phew! Although this seems like it was a lot of work to use command
line arguments, actually, eventually you'll find that Eclipse's method
will save you a lot of time. Here's why: Eclipse actually saved your
command line argument so you can run it again without typing. To see
this, click on the little black arrow next to the run button. Above
<code>Run As</code> and <code>Run Configurations</code>, you should see another option
(probably <code>Year</code>). Click it, and it should re-run your code with the
argument you just used!</p>

<p>The real utility is that you can save various different arguments you
might want to use under different names. Go back to the run
configurations menu, and notice there's a <code>Name</code> box at the top that
probably contains something like <code>Year</code>. Try changing the name to
something descriptive, such as <code>Checking 2000</code>, and then hit <code>Apply</code>.</p>

<p>If we want to run with a different argument instead, such as 2001, we
can create another run configuration for it. In the <code>Run
Configurations</code> menu, select the <code>New launch configuration</code> button in
the upper left. Then change its argument to 2001 and give it a new
name like <code>Checking 2001</code>. Then click <code>Apply</code> and <code>Run</code> to run it.</p>

<p>Now click the little black arrow next to the green run button again.
You should see an option for <code>Checking 2000</code> and <code>Checking 2001</code>. So
you now can switch between running either one very quickly. Later on,
when you encouter programs that require long strings of command line
arguments, this can save you a <em>ton</em> of re-typing!</p>


<h4 id="creating-new-code">Creating New Code</h4>


<p>Now that we know how to edit and run code, let's learn to how to
create a new java file. Easy enough, just go to <code>File &gt; New &gt; Class</code>.
A new window will pop up. The only information you need to fill out is
<code>Name</code>. Then click <code>Finish</code>. That's it!</p>

<p>Technically, you need to fill out the <code>Source folder</code> section as well,
but if you have your current project selected, this should be filled
out by default for you. In addition, you may notice that Eclipse tells
you it's not a good idea to leave the <code>Package</code> section blank; true
enough, but for now just ignore it. We'll get to packages later in the
class.</p>


<h2 id="e-satisfying-the-style-guide">E. Satisfying the Style Guide</h2>


<p>Your code in 61B is required to meet certain style conventions. It
turns out that Eclipse can be used to satisfy many of these
automatically! I'll give you tips on getting that set up at a later
date.</p>

<p>Right now, however, it's important that we at least fix one thing. By
default, Eclipse uses tabs, but the style guide forces you to use no
tabs at all, and instead to replace them all with spaces. This is because
there is no fixed meaning for tab; Python, for example, declares tab to be
8 spaces, and Eclipse sets it to 4 by default, but allows individual projects
to change that convention. So let's change Eclipse's behavior.</p>

<p>Go to <code>Eclipse &gt; Preferences &gt; Java &gt; Code Style &gt; Formatter</code>. Create a
new active profile. Give it a descriptive name like "61B Format",
intialize it with Eclipse [built-in], then hit <code>OK</code>, opening the edit
dialog. Go to the <code>Indentation</code> tab and set the tab policy to "Spaces
only". Hit <code>OK</code>. The indentation and tab sizes should both be 4.
Now make sure you have your 61B profile selected, hit
<code>Apply</code>, and hit <code>OK</code>.</p>

<p>From now on, Eclipse will use spaces to auto-indent. Also, whenever
you press tab, it will insert 4 spaces instead, so feel free to use
tab on your computer.</p>

<p>If you have code that already had tabs in it, it's now easy to change
them all to spaces. Simply navigate to the file and hit <code>Ctrl + Shift

list&#x2d;db9909f18fb69e20d8289df7602f062c70f35f2f&#x2d;list

F. Adding Libraries
&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;&#x2d;

Sometimes we&#x27;d like to give our projects access to other code written
by other people that we downloaded. Here we provide some
instructions for setting this up neatly.

&lt;!&#x2d;&#x2d; FIXME &#x2d;&#x2d;&gt;

Let&#x27;s add the .jar files you downloded in lab1c. In order to access
these in Eclipse, we must add them to _each_ project that wants to use
them. To recap, here&#x27;s the basic thing to do: Right click on the
project that needs access, then go to</code>Build Path > Add External
Archives...<code>. Then select the .jar files you want and hit okay. You
should now be able to access them all within the project. That&#x27;s all
you really need.

However, it&#x27;s a little annoying to add all of the .jar files in every
project, so one thing we can do to facilitate the process is to create
a _user library_. This is essentially a grouping of .jar files, so all
we have to do is add in the one user library instead of all the .jar
files.

As an example, let&#x27;s let&#x27;s make a user library out of all the .jar
files you downloaded in lab1c. Go to</code>Window > Preferences > Java >
Build Path > User Libraries<code>. Create a new one. Give it a descriptive
name such as &quot;61B_LIB&quot;. Now select</code>Add External JARs...<code>and select
all of the .jar files you downloaded in lab1c. Hit</code>OK<code>.

That was a bit of a hassle, but it&#x27;ll now be easier to add these .jar
files into a project. Right click on the project, then go to</code>Build
Path > Add Library<code>. Select</code>User Library<code>and hit</code>Next>`. Check the
user library you created and finish to add all the .jar files at once.
That's it!</p>


<h2 id="g-troubleshooting">G. Troubleshooting</h2>


<p>If you're following the directions here carefully and things aren't
turning out as expected... I'm not surprised. Eclipse can seem really
finicky when you're first getting started with it. Try googling the
problem, or asking one of your friends. If that fails, you could
attempt a piazza post, but be aware that issues with Eclipse may be
difficult to deal with over piazza because Eclipse is so visual. So if
that fails, I recommend visiting office hours. I can't speak for other
staff members' experience with Eclipse, but you can definitely come to
mine. With that said: Good luck, and happy coding!</p>
